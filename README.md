## Polylastic protocol


_The Polylastic (POLX) Index is designed to track token performance within the ever-evolving Elastic Finance industry (EFi). Our index will include elastic cryptocurrencies, seigniorage tokens, algorithmic stablecoins, cash systems and whatever comes next. The index is weighted based on the value of community support measured by the number of stakers, as well as the market cap of the token._

_This novel mechanism allows us to capture both technical innovation and community strength. Like traditional indices, Polylastic will track projects with significant usage and demand as well as those that show a vibrant community and commitment to ongoing development.._
